# Algorithms In Ruby

This repository has a number of different algorithm problems from the cirriculum at MakerSquare. Since Ruby is a high level language with a large library of built in methods involving "sorting", "pushing", "poping", etc., it was very interesting to get under the hood and see how these methods are actually working.

### Summary of methods and algorithms 
- Arrays (push, pop, stacks, queues)
- Binary tree (create, order, traverse)
- Fibonacci
- Hashes
- Linked Lists
- Recursion (when recursion is good, versus when it can be bad)
